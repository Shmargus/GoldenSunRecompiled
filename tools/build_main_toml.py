# `confidence = "unresolved"` purely because its declared extent contains
# ELF-marked literal pools (see `function_transitions` in
# import_main_symbols.py), so the finder never reaches it and nothing seeds it.
#
# That is a corpus conservatism, not missing evidence: those symbols passed
# every entry-level check (symtab value, mapping-symbol mode, PT_LOAD source,

# Scope is every executable ROM section from the reset vector through
# `rom_8a000`, plus `rom_a1000` and `rom_c9000`. `rom_a1000` and `rom_c9000`
# were previously held back by a finder defect: the compiler emits long
# intra-function branches at 0x080ac342 (in `rom_a1000`) and 0x080e578a /
# 0x080e5ac6 (in `rom_c9000`) as `BL`, and the finder treated a `BL` as a
# returning call, so it resumed decoding at literal-pool bytes correctly
# marked `$d`. That defect is now fixed upstream in `gbarecomp`: the finder
# recognises a `BL` whose CONTINUATION address `pc + 4` lands inside a declared
# `data_range` as non-returning and does not enqueue it. (The test is on the
# continuation, not the branch target, and on the declared data_range, not the
# caller's ELF extent - a returning call cannot have a literal pool as its
# return address, which is what makes the collision proof rather than a
# heuristic.) Both sections are therefore seeded here; the acceptance gate is
# the collision-free regeneration this change was made under, not a re-review
# of every symbol in the two sections.
#
# `rom_770` is the IWRAM image already covered by [[code_copy]] and its own
# explicit reviewed entries, so it is not seeded wholesale here.
